## Mission

TeraSystemsAI designs and engineers AI systems intended for environments where **errors carry real consequences**.

Our focus is not on benchmark performance alone, but on **how systems behave under uncertainty, data shift, and operational constraints**. We emphasize transparency, auditability, and explicit tradeoffs in model design and deployment.

We refer to this philosophy as **Constraint-Aware AI Engineering**.

---

## What We Build

### Core Domains

- **Healthcare AI**  
  Probabilistic and Bayesian models designed to surface uncertainty in diagnostic and decision-support workflows.

- **Security & Integrity Systems**  
  Cryptographic and statistical methods for document verification, fraud detection, and trust assessment.

- **Research Intelligence**  
  Retrieval-augmented systems to support literature review, evidence synthesis, and large-scale document analysis.

- **Enterprise NLP**  
  Multilingual text processing, document understanding, and controlled generation for organizational use.

- **Generative AI (with constraints)**  
  Fact-grounded generation pipelines with explicit controls, evaluation, and traceability.

---

## Engineering Principles

Our systems are built around the following principles:

- **Uncertainty is explicit, not implicit**  
- **Evaluation extends beyond single metrics**  
- **Failure modes are identified early**  
- **Human accountability is preserved**  
- **Production behavior matters more than demos**

---

## Technology Stack (Indicative)

## Open Source

This organization hosts selected open-source projects that reflect our engineering and research approach:

- Reference implementations  
- Supporting tools for evaluation and monitoring  
- Documentation and reproducible examples  

Repositories prioritize **clarity, correctness, and maintainability** over novelty.

---

## Contribution Philosophy

We welcome contributions aligned with our goals:

- Research implementations with clear assumptions  
- Engineering improvements that enhance reliability  
- Documentation that improves understanding and reproducibility  

All contributions are expected to follow rigorous review and testing standards.
